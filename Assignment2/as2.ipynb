You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages, <b> except </b> Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Gensim, Keras and Pytorch.

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",
    "- You should build a **standard bigram language model**; i.e. do not do anything complicated like a bidirectional bigram language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."

    "I used bidirectional_heptagram_backoff model as my solution. At the top of question 5 section I create a funtion to easily build a bidirectional_n-gram model for future use. In Q6 implementations, My function will dectect the conditions of backoff. Whenever high-level ngram doesnt have the certain letter-combinations or follow the condition of use, it will back-off to next level lower n-gram, untill it goes 1gram, which must have the probability. This algorithm has also been used in another direction backoff. For improve the accuracy, I chose different coefficients when using high-level n-gram, whose probability should more confident about the result. Due to the lower ngram condition will repeat more than higher ngram condition, but they should less confident than higher one. So the coefficients was also important in my solution. However, the result is barely improved from haxagram to heptagram, This phenomenon suggests that the marginal effect may already be present.\n",
